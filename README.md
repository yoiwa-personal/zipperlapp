# zipperlapp - Make an executable perl script bundle using zip archive

This program bundles several Perl module files and wraps them as an
"executable" zip archive.  An output file can be invoked as a Perl
script, or (if a source file contains a `#!` line) as a directly
executable command.  Also, it can be handled by (almost every) zip
archiver as an "sfx" file.

Inside Perl scripts, all files contained in the archive is put in the
top of the searched library set.  The program can simply use `use` or
`require` statements to load the contained modules, without modifying
the `@INC` variable.

Run `zipperlapp --help` or `perldoc zipperlapp` for usage.

## Content of the source package / Git repository

The script `zipperlapp` is a standalone portable binary Perl script
packed by this tool itself.  Its source code is `zipperlapp.pl`.  See
`Makefile` for how to regenerate the packed file.
